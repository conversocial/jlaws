### 0.1.6
  Bug Fixes
  - The xml cookbook has locked nokogiri to a specific version.
    Installing aws-sdk-v1 gem at compile times conflict with this and breaks
    any system that tries to use xml cookbook >= 1.28. The route53 cookbook
    depends on xml.
    Detect xml's pinning and install the same version of nokogiri.
